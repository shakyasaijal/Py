Torvalds quipped about the name git (which means unpleasant person in British English slang): "I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First 'Linux', now 'git'."[23][24] The man page describes Git as "the stupid content tracker".[25] The readme file of the source code elaborates further:[26]

The name "git" was given by Linus Torvalds when he wrote the very
first version. He described the tool as "the stupid content tracker"
and the name as (depending on your way):

 - random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not
   actually used by any common UNIX command.  The fact that it is a
   mispronunciation of "get" may or may not be relevant.
 - stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple. Take your pick from the
   dictionary of slang.
 - "global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually
   works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
 - "goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t": when it breaks

cd ~/icecream
Next, initialize Git so you can start using Git commands inside the folder. The folder is now a Git repository.

git init
Wait, this is the right folder, right? Here’s how you check and make sure this is where you stored your design:

git status
And this is what Git will tell you in reply:

# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add ..." to include in what will be committed)

#

#       chocolate.jpeg
There they are! Add them to your local Git repository so they’ll be tracked by Git.

git add chocolate.jpeg
Now, take a “snapshot” of the repository as it stands now with the commit command:

git commit -m “Add chocolate.jpeg.”
Great! But your co-workers, hard at work in their own local repositories, can’t see your fantastic new design. That’s because the main project is stored in the company GitHub account (username: 123WebDesign) in the repository called “icecream.”

Since you haven’t connected to the GitHub repo yet, your computer doesn’t even know this exists. So tell your local repository about it:

git remote add origin https://github.com/123WebDesign/icecream.git
And double check to make sure it knows:

git remote -v
Finally, it’s the moment you’ve been waiting for. Upload that delicious looking sundae up to the project:

git push
Ta da! With all of these tool at hand, it’s clear that Git and the GitHub service aren’t just for programmers.
